I have setup too many beaglebone and raspberries for IoT gateways.  I did have a
nice check list of each step to take, then someone showed me [ansible](https://www.ansible.com).

So working towards all of that automation.


I don't install ansible on my machine, but instead run it inside a [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).
